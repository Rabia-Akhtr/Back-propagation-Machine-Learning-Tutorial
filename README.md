Introduction
Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used to optimize Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This project demonstrates the working of Backpropagation and its application in training neural networks using Python. It includes theoretical insights and a hands-on implementation using the MNIST dataset for digit classification.

What is Backpropagation?
Backpropagation is an algorithm used to minimize the error in an ANN by adjusting the weights of the network. The key steps include:

Forward Propagation: Input data is passed through the network to generate predictions.
Backpropagation: The error (loss) between predicted and true outputs is propagated backward through the network, adjusting weights to minimize this error.
This process repeats iteratively, improving the network’s accuracy with each cycle.

Example: Teacher-Student Analogy
In this analogy, the neural network is like a student learning from a teacher:

Inputs (data): The lessons taught to the student.
Forward pass: The student takes an exam after studying, making predictions.
Loss: The difference between the student’s predictions and the correct answers.
Backpropagation: The teacher provides feedback to help the student improve by adjusting future predictions.
Why Use Backpropagation?
Backpropagation is widely used in training neural networks because it:

Improves model accuracy: By adjusting weights iteratively, it helps the model make more accurate predictions.
Efficiently optimizes large networks: It allows the training of deep networks with many layers.
Works with various network architectures: Can be applied to feedforward networks, convolutional networks, and more.
Key Concepts
Forward Propagation
In forward propagation, input data is passed through the network, and the network produces an output prediction. The network applies weights, biases, and activation functions to process the inputs.

Backpropagation
Backpropagation works by calculating the loss (error) between predicted and actual values, then updating the weights to minimize this loss. This involves calculating gradients using the chain rule and adjusting the weights accordingly.

Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is the optimization algorithm used in backpropagation to minimize the loss function. It adjusts the weights in the direction that reduces the loss.

Building a Neural Network in Python
This repository provides Python code for building a simple neural network model with:

Input Layer: Takes raw data (e.g., images).
Hidden Layers: Performs intermediate computations.
Output Layer: Produces the final prediction (e.g., digit classification).
The code is implemented in Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding and reproducibility.

Training the Network
The network is trained using backpropagation by iterating over the dataset, calculating the loss, and updating the weights to minimize the error. The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is used to demonstrate the training process.

Visualizing Loss Reduction
Loss reduction over epochs is visualized to show how the network improves over time as the weights are adjusted. This helps demonstrate the effectiveness of backpropagation in reducing error.

Limitations and Overfitting
Backpropagation has some limitations:

Overfitting: The model may perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data.
Sensitivity to hyperparameters: The choice of learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size can affect the model's performance.
Mitigation strategies include:

Pruning: Removing unnecessary layers to reduce complexity.
Regularization: Techniques like dropout can help prevent overfitting.
Early stopping: Halting training once the model performance stabilizes.
Applications of Backpropagation
Backpropagation is used in various industries, including:

Healthcare: Diagnosing diseases based on medical data.
E-commerce: Recommending products based on user behavior.
Finance: Predicting stock prices or loan approvals.
Computer Vision: Object detection and image classification.
